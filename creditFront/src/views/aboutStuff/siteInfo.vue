    <h3>I like credit cards a lot</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since recently discovering the subreddit r/churning, I've always
      been fascinated by credit card rewards. Free money and cute looking
      cards! Kinda like Pok√©mon cards, but with no skill requirement to
      make money with them. It had to be too good to be true. After a bit more life experience
      and research, I'm happy to report that it really is that good, unless you
      carry a balance/pay late.
      Shoutout to the US's legendary culture of spending/lending/debt management
      for enabling this. I don't think any other country's credit cards even come
      close.
