    <h3>I like credit cards a lot</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since recently discovering the subreddit
      <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/"
        target="_blank"
      >r/churning</a>, I've always
      been fascinated by credit card rewards. Free money and cute looking
      cards! Kinda like Pok√©mon cards, but with no skill requirement to
      make money with them. It had to be too good to be true. After a bit more life experience
      and research, I'm happy to report that it really is that good, unless you
      carry a balance/pay late.
      Shoutout to the US's legendary culture of spending/lending/debt management
      for making this all possible. I don't think any other country's credit cards even come
      close.

    <h3>There are a lot of good credit cards</h3>
    <p>
      It can be really time-consuming to sift through the options to find
      whatever cards benefit you the most. I can relate, I don't even want to
      think about how much time I spent reading credit card forums and subreddits.
      Dividing the amount of rewards I've earned vs. that time probably yields a
      very poor hourly rate. I'm fine with it though, it's a hobby and most hobbies
      tend to do pretty badly in that regard.

    <p>
      But for those who don't like putting in a lot of time (almost everyone else),
      I feel like the time I put in finding worthwhile cards can save you a lot of
      time in seeing what fits your spending best.

    <h3>Comparison should be easy, personalized, and unbiased</h3>
    <p>
      If you google search "compare credit cards", everything is either:
      <br />
      <br />1: a bank
      <br />2: NerdWallet type site
      <br />
      <br />All definitely useful, they give more info and look a lot better than my site.
      But all of them (or at least all of them on the first 3 pages of that google search) basically
      have no meaningful personalization other than "what's your credit score" and "travel rewards or
      cash back". I figured

      Almost all of these are also biased. The banks obviously only advertising their own
      cards, but the other websites focus on the
