    <h1>Why I made this site</h1>
    <h3>I like credit cards a lot</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since discovering
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/" target="_blank">r/churning</a>, I've always
      been fascinated by credit card rewards. Free money and cute looking
      cards! Kinda like PokÃ©mon cards, but with no skill requirement to
      make money with them. It had to be too good to be true. After a bit more life experience
      and research, I'm happy to report that it really is that good.
      Shoutout to the US's legendary culture of spending/lending/debt management
      for making this all possible. I don't think any other country's credit cards even come
      close.

    <h3>There are a lot of good credit cards</h3>
    <p>
      It can be really time-consuming to sift through the options to find
      whatever cards benefit you the most. I can relate, I don't even want to
      think about how much time I spent reading credit card forums and subreddits.
      Dividing the amount of rewards I've earned vs. that time probably yields a
      very poor hourly rate. But I'm fine with it, it's a hobby and most hobbies
      tend to do pretty badly in that regard.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those who don't like putting in a lot of time, I hope
      the time I put in finding worthwhile cards and making this website
      can save you a lot of time and money in seeing what fits your spending best.

    <h3>This kind of comparison should be easy</h3>
    <p>
      I figured it would be easy to do make a tool like this, it's just adding and multiplying things, right?
      I couldn't find a site to do this with more than their own cards, at least on the first three pages of
      a "compare credit cards" google search.
      So I made this web app. Originally this was just to save me time in comparing cards, but I probably ended up
      spending way more time making this web app than it would have taken me to compare cards myself.
      It's too late to turn back now though ðŸ˜¢
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparison based on spending amounts is completely objective and tailored perfectly to your spending
      (with a few exceptions detailed ${here}).
      I think it's a great way to compare credit cards, although it shouldn't be the only research you do.
      Numbers can't represent everything a card can offer.

    <h3>Learning more about programming</h3>

      I enjoy programming/web development, so this was a fun way to learn more about web dev. More details
